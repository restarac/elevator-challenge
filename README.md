A challenge to solve the elevator problem

# Telling the history
So we need at least some background history to understand this problem, so here we go.

Imagine that you are a kind of a new Startup owner, a ElevatorKrupp Company, and you goal , as a company, is to project 
and design a software capable to choose the best option to a person in a determinate floor of a office building.

In this case, you are a new guy in this business and you are trying to figure out how to develop that, so there is more information about that...

# First Scenario

https://5.imimg.com/data5/RT/GX/MY-22136372/elevator-for-office-building-supplier-500x500.jpg

- There are a Office Building with 10 floors and 2 elevators.
- There are 4 companies in this building
  - Floor: 1-2; company 1 (25 employes in each floor)
  - Floor: 3; company 2 (20 employes)
  - Floor: 5; company 3 (30 employes)
  - Floor: 7-8-9; company 4 (50 employes in each floor)
 
- The elevator's equipament has a way to inform the correct floor you want before call it (a panel with numbers in the building hall).
- The elevator travels at speed 5 floors per minute.
- The elevator maximum capacity is about 1080KG (aproximately 16 peoples).

**How much time you will take to travel all the employes to its companies?**
(think that everyone are on the building hall waiting the elevator, so less time is better.)

Show your code and results.

# Second Scenario

Assuming that you will continue, so you are a more succesfuly Startup Owner, and you company grownth without limits, so it's time for you next challenge.
